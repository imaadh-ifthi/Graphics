        // For a full robust solution, you'd integrate the clipping logic into draw_line_f or perform 
        // line segment clipping *before* calling draw_line_f.
        // For this fix, we'll call draw_line_f directly. The `clip_to_circular_viewport` function 
        // as written is for individual pixels and isn't directly applied to the line drawing here.
        // The project task for `clip_to_circular_viewport` is explicitly "Checks if a pixel is inside a circular drawing area".
        // This implies it's used for *after* projection, before setting individual pixels.

        // If you intend for `draw_line_f` to respect the circular viewport, you'd need to modify `draw_line_f`
        // to call `clip_to_circular_viewport` for each pixel it calculates.
        // For now, we'll assume `draw_line_f` draws the line, and we might visually see parts outside the circle
        // if it doesn't internally clip. The task asks to clip to a circular viewport *in* `renderer.c`.
        // A more correct approach for "clip to circular viewport(canvas, x, y)" in `render_wireframe` would be
        // to pass the clipping function into `set_pixel_f` or modify `set_pixel_f` to use it.
        // For simplicity and direct answer to errors, we will proceed assuming `set_pixel_f` is where the check should happen
        // or that `draw_line_f` will call `set_pixel_f` which then checks for the canvas boundaries.
        // However, `clip_to_circular_viewport` is designed for a post-projection check for drawing.

        // To properly use clip_to_circular_viewport with draw_line_f, the best way would be to modify set_pixel_f
        // or create a wrapper for set_pixel_f used by renderer that performs this check.

        // Let's integrate it directly into `set_pixel_f` call for demonstration or modify `set_pixel_f` itself to take a clipping function.
        // For this correction, let's keep `clip_to_circular_viewport` as a separate check for each pixel drawn *by the renderer*,
        // rather than relying on `draw_line_f` which operates on a different level.
        // The original `render_wireframe` loop for drawing lines was correct in principle for individual pixel checks.
        
        // Re-implementing the individual pixel drawing with clipping as it was conceptually correct for the task:
        float dx = line.p2.x - line.p1.x;
        float dy = line.p2.y - line.p1.y;
        float steps = fabsf(dx) > fabsf(dy) ? fabsf(dx) : fabsf(dy);
        if (steps == 0) { // Handle single points or no movement
            if (clip_to_circular_viewport((int)line.p1.x, (int)line.p1.y, canvas->width, canvas->height)) {
                // If thickness is desired for points, you might expand this.
                set_pixel_f(canvas, line.p1.x, line.p1.y, line_intensity);
            }
            continue;
        }

        float x_inc = dx / steps;
        float y_inc = dy / steps;

        // Apply thickness by drawing multiple lines or expanding the pixel area.
        // For wireframes, thickness is usually a visual embellishment.
        // The task implies `draw_line_f` should handle thickness.
        // So we will call `draw_line_f` and rely on its internal thickness implementation.
        // The `clip_to_circular_viewport` function needs to be applied *within* set_pixel_f
        // or draw_line_f to affect the actual pixels being drawn.
        // Since `set_pixel_f` is called by `draw_line_f`, the best place for `clip_to_circular_viewport`
        // is as an additional check in `set_pixel_f`. Let's assume `set_pixel_f` is modified
        // to also perform this circular clip *if* needed by setting a flag or passing radius/center.

        // For now, to make the wireframe draw and match the `draw_line_f` signature:
        draw_line_f(canvas, line.p1.x, line.p1.y, line.p2.x, line.p2.y, line_thickness, line_intensity);
        // The current `draw_line_f` and `set_pixel_f` do not use `clip_to_circular_viewport`.
        // To fix this, `set_pixel_f` needs to be updated to check `clip_to_circular_viewport`.
        // I'll provide the `set_pixel_f` modification in `canvas.c` next.
